MCP server for Siemens SIMATIC TIA Portal V21. It lets MCP clients and AI agents inspect a running TIA Portal project through the Siemens Openness API.

The current implementation covers project discovery and lifecycle operations, PLC block export/import, tag table reads and guarded tag mutations, hardware/network discovery, cross-reference diagnostics, hardware catalog search, guarded network-device provisioning, and compile/check diagnostics.

## Tools

The server currently exposes 23 tools in read-write mode and 6 tools in read-only mode.

### Batch operations

- `execute_read_batch` - run up to 50 retained generic read operations in one call. Each item carries an `operationId`, an `operation` name (e.g. `get_block_content`, `list_tag_tables`), and that operation's parameters. Reads run independently, so a failing item does not stop the others. Bound `read_cross_references` with `maxResults`; oversized batch responses are truncated or omitted server-side with explicit markers.
- `preview_write_batch` / `apply_write_batch` - preview up to 50 retained generic data writes and receive one batch-level `safetyToken` bound to the exact ordered operation list and the combined current state, then apply them. Apply runs sequentially, stops on the first failure, and marks later items `skipped` (no transaction or rollback). Requires `confirm=true` and the `safetyToken`. Project-lifecycle and network writes stay dedicated.

The generic batch tools are the path for retained block, PLC type, tag-table, tag, and user-constant operations. Each `operation` name carries that operation's parameters as one item; a single operation is just a one-item batch.

Every operation result may carry a `warnings` array — non-fatal degradation notes captured from the TIA Openness worker. A populated `warnings` array means the payload may be partial.

Available read operations for `execute_read_batch`: `read_cross_references`, `get_block_content`, `list_tag_tables`, and `get_type_content`.

Available write operations (for `preview_write_batch` / `apply_write_batch`): `update_block_logic`, `update_type_content`, `create_block` / `delete_block`, `create_block_group` / `delete_block_group`, `create_tag_table` / `delete_tag_table`, `create_tag` / `update_tag` / `delete_tag`, `create_user_constant` / `update_user_constant` / `delete_user_constant`.

`get_block_content` / `update_block_logic` and `get_type_content` / `update_type_content` accept a `format` field. `format=source` is available for global data blocks, PLC data types, and SCL-language FB/FC/OB. Every other block language stays on `format=xml`.

`withDependencies` (reads only, default `false`) asks TIA Portal to include the object's dependency closure. The resulting document declares several objects and is **context only** — a write refuses any source declaring more than one object, and the read carries a warning saying so. Omit the field to get a document you can edit and submit back.

### Network operations

`network_read` and `network_write` both declare an MCP output schema and return one canonical JSON document identically as the `content` text block and as `structuredContent` — never a nested JSON string inside an outer envelope. This is the Phase 2 JSON contract; see [docs/SupportedOperations/NETWORK_OPERATIONS_SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/Czarnak/tia-portal-mcp/blob/main/docs/SupportedOperations/NETWORK_OPERATIONS_SUMMARY.md) for the exact envelopes.

- `network_read` - run up to 50 dedicated network reads: `read_hardware_config` and `search_equipment_catalog`. Reads run independently. Bound catalog searches with `query` and `maxResults`; when a network response is truncated, use the returned network-specific hint to narrow or split the request.
- `network_write` - preview or apply up to 50 dedicated network writes: `add_network_device` (flat `typeIdentifier`/`deviceName`, since it names something that does not exist yet), `configure_network_device` (nested `target: { deviceName, nodeId }` plus `changes: { ipAddress?, subnetMask?, pnDeviceName?, subnet?: { subnetId }, ioSystem?: { subnetId, number } }` — a null `changes` member means leave that setting unchanged), `create_subnet` (`subnet: { name, networkType }`, plus PROFIBUS-only `highestAddress`/`transmissionSpeed`), `update_subnet` (`target: { subnetId }` plus `subnetChanges` with at least one member), and `delete_subnet` (`target: { subnetId }` — connected or not). Call with `confirm:false` and no token for a preview, then call the same tool with `confirm:true`, the unchanged ordered list, and the returned `safetyToken`. Apply is sequential, stops on the first failure, marks later items skipped, and does not roll back completed writes: `network_write` attaches an explicit warning to the failed item that this operation and any earlier operation in the same call may already have changed TIA state, and that you should re-read with `network_read` before retrying rather than blindly re-running the batch.

`configure_network_device` targets one exact existing node: `target.deviceName` (case-insensitive) plus the exact `target.nodeId` reported by a prior `network_read` — never the first interface or first node on a device. `changes.subnet.subnetId` and `changes.ioSystem.subnetId`/`changes.ioSystem.number` are similarly exact, subnet-scoped selectors. Selector resolution is fail-closed: a selector that matches zero, more than one, or an unreadable candidate always fails with `postcondition_failed` rather than falling back to a guess. This is what makes it safe to target one port on a multi-homed device (a PC station with several network interfaces, for example) — configuring one node's exact `nodeId` changes only that node; every other node on the device is left byte-for-byte unchanged. Always follow a `network_write` apply with a `network_read` (`read_hardware_config`) post-read to confirm the outcome — the response never echoes back a re-read of the written value.

`read_hardware_config` additionally reports unreadable members in a payload-level `messages` array; device/module name and type-identifier fields omit values that could not be read instead of returning `0`/empty-string placeholders (a few secondary name fields still fall back to an empty string, with the failure noted in `messages`). Hardware configuration data is engineering evidence, not certification that a physical installation has been commissioned.

A separately authorized, PowerShell 7 live-TIA acceptance harness for this contract lives at `scripts/live-test-network-phase2.ps1`. It is never run by any automated test; see the script's own comment-based help for its `Read`/`Preview`/`Apply` modes and required confirmation gates.
Available write operations (for `preview_write_batch` / `apply_write_batch`): `update_block_logic`, `update_type_content`, `create_block` / `delete_block`, `create_block_group` / `delete_block_group`, `create_tag_table` / `delete_tag_table`, `create_tag` / `update_tag` / `delete_tag`, `create_user_constant` / `update_user_constant` / `delete_user_constant`, `add_network_device`, `configure_network_device`, `start_plc` / `stop_plc`.

### Project tools

- `get_project_status` — read active project metadata without opening or switching projects.
- `browse_project_tree` — browse a bounded project subtree with optional `depth` and `startPath`.
- `compile_check` — compile a PLC or selected block and return compiler messages; available only in read-write mode.
- `open_project` / `create_project` / `save_project` / `save_project_as` / `archive_project` / `close_project` - project lifecycle writes. These stay single-tool only (not batchable) and are self-previewing: call the tool WITHOUT `safetyToken` to get a preview plus a single-use token, then call it again with `confirm=true` and the token to apply.

### OPC UA interface tools

This fork adds guarded management of TIA Portal OPC UA user-modelled interfaces:

- `list_opcua_interfaces` - list the configured interfaces for one PLC.
- `inspect_opcua_variables` - inspect the generated variables and their read/write exposure.
- `export_opcua_interface` - export the current interface model and catalog to disk.
- `preview_generate_opcua_interface` / `generate_opcua_interface` - preview and generate an interface model from the PLC variables.
- `preview_set_opcua_interface_enabled` / `set_opcua_interface_enabled` - preview and change the enabled state.
- `preview_delete_opcua_interface` / `delete_opcua_interface` - preview and delete an interface.

Every OPC UA mutation uses the same safety-token contract as the other writes. Generation and export bind the token to the resolved project and PLC identity, include a model fingerprint in the current-state hash, and restore the previous interface/output files when a downstream operation fails.

## Write safety

Every MCP write operation uses a preview-then-apply workflow. Generic batch data writes preview with `preview_write_batch` and apply with `apply_write_batch`. Network and project lifecycle writes are self-previewing: call the same write tool WITHOUT `safetyToken` (with `confirm:false` for `network_write`) to get the preview (summary, `currentStateHash`, `requestedInputHash`, a fresh single-use `safetyToken`, and `instructions`), review it, then call the same tool again with the same arguments plus `confirm=true` and the `safetyToken`.

Safety tokens are single-use, expire 10 minutes after preview, and are bound to the exact tool name, normalized project path, target, requested input, and current project state. The server rejects missing, expired, reused, mismatched, or stale-state tokens. Successful write attempts append audit JSONL records under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TiaMcpServer\audit`.

`preview_write_batch` issues one token for the whole batch, bound to the exact ordered operation list and the combined current state. Reordering items, changing any item's input, retargeting the project path, or a change in project state all invalidate the token. `apply_write_batch` re-reads the combined current state once before consuming the token, then applies items sequentially and stops on the first failure.

`network_write` snapshots topology once for preview and once for apply-time token validation. Its token is bound to the exact ordered network operation list and project state; successful apply attempts append an audit record.

Every failed write reports a categorized `failureCategory` field alongside its human-readable `error` message, so a caller can branch on the exact failure without parsing text: `validation_error`, `binding_conflict`, `state_changed`, `worker_operation_failed`, `worker_timeout`, `worker_crashed`, or `postcondition_failed`. `save_project_as` requires `rebind:true`; calling it with `rebind:false` is rejected up front with `validation_error` before any preview, safety-token issuance, Siemens `SaveAs` call, or audit write, so it has no side effects. Warnings are always reported in a separate `warnings` array from the primary success/failure outcome — a populated `warnings` array never turns a failure into a success, and a categorized failure is never masked by an accompanying warning.

## Architecture

TIA Portal V21 ships its Openness API as .NET Framework 4.8 assemblies. Those assemblies use .NET Framework remoting APIs that cannot run correctly inside a .NET 8 process.

This project therefore uses two processes:

- `TiaMcpServer` - the .NET 8 MCP stdio server and .NET global tool host.
- `TiaMcpServer.OpennessWorker` - a .NET Framework 4.8 worker process that loads `Siemens.Engineering.*` and talks to TIA Portal.

The MCP host keeps one persistent .NET Framework 4.8 worker process attached to TIA Portal and exchanges newline-delimited JSON over stdin/stdout. Requests are serialized, and the worker restarts automatically after a crash or timeout. Siemens DLLs are never copied into this repository or the NuGet package; the worker resolves them from the local TIA Portal V21 installation.


## Quick start

Install the server as a .NET global tool, check your environment, and register it with an MCP client:

```powershell
dotnet tool install -g TiaMcpServer
tia-mcp doctor
tia-mcp install claude-code
```

`tia-mcp doctor` validates Windows version, .NET runtimes, the TIA Portal installation, Openness
assemblies, user-group membership, and host/worker compatibility before you connect anything. Run it
first — it reports exactly which prerequisite is missing.

| Prerequisite | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Windows-only; the Openness API has no other host |
| Siemens TIA Portal V21 | with Openness installed and enabled |
| `Siemens TIA Openness` group | the current Windows user must be a member |
| .NET SDK 8.0 or newer | required by `dotnet tool install` |
| .NET Framework 4.8 runtime | required by the Openness worker process |

Supported clients for `tia-mcp install`: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, MiMoCode. Servers register in
**read-only** mode by default; add `--access-mode read-write` to expose the write tools.

Binding to a specific project, every install option, and the full access-mode reference are in the
[installation guide](https://github.com/Czarnak/tia-portal-mcp/blob/main/docs/guides/installation.md). To build from source instead of installing
the published tool, see [building from source](https://github.com/Czarnak/tia-portal-mcp/blob/main/docs/development/building.md).
